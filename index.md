# Lab Report 4 â€“  Vim

## Part 1

Changing the name of the `start` parameter and its uses to `base` using the vim commands:
`/start<Enter>cebase<Escape>n.n.n.:wq<Enter>`

## Part 2

First Style: I took 240 seconds to make the edit because the difficulties are finding where I need to edit, typing scp command and shh command take a lot of time.

Second Style: I took 120 seconds to make the edit because it is efficient using Vim commands to make a edit, the only difficulty that I cross using Vim is remember all the commands.

I would refer using Vim to make the edit for the task chose in Vim if I had to work on a progra that I were running remotely because the vim command that I learn to edit a file is really fast. If I choose the first style, sometime the files are too big and it will take a long time to upload the files to the remote server.

I will use VScode to program something because VScode will highlight my errors, color my codes and suggest me how to fix the error. Other hand Vim will not color or hightlight any of my error, bland texts will make my code unreadable.
